## Designing the Application to Verify Input Reception

To check whether the input is received or not, you can use the provided block coding in your application. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you with the process:

1. Open your app development environment (e.g., MIT App Inventor) and create a new project or open your existing project.

2. Drag and drop the necessary components onto your app's design canvas. Ensure you have the required user interface elements to initiate and display the input checking process.

3. Use the provided block coding, which can be seen in the image above, as a reference to implement the logic for checking input reception. Modify the code to suit your application's specific requirements.

4. Test your app on a connected device or emulator to ensure that it successfully checks for input reception and responds accordingly.
